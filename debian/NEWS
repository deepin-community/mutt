mutt (2.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  A bunch of important changes were introduced by upstream starting from 2.x
  versions, a full changelog is available on
  https://gitlab.com/muttmua/mutt/raw/stable/UPDATING
  This subset of changes are what are changes to the default values and/or
  behavior.
   + Buffy completion only occurs for the "change-folder" set of functions.
     It has been disabled for <attach-message>, <write-fcc>, the fcc
     mailbox prompt, and the autocrypt scan mailbox prompt.
   + The "save/copy message to mailbox" set of functions use the "mailbox"
     history list, instead of the "filename" list.
   + Message-ID extraction permits values missing angle brackets and '@'
     to allow properly threading the garbage sent by some providers.
     Mutt will add missing angle brackets when sending out replies, however.
   + When adding multiple attachments, via <attach-file> in the compose menu,
     the browser menu can be exiting via <quit> after tagging the files.
     Previously, <select-entry> had to be used.
   + ctrl-p/ctrl-n are by default bound to <history-up>/<history-down> in the
     editor menu.
   + The "cd" command allows changing the current working directory.
     As part of this, Mutt expands relative paths internally.  There
     may be a change to some "prettified" relative paths because of this.
   + Mutt will try to automatically reconnect to an IMAP mailbox on error,
     and will merge unsync'ed changes if possible.
   + $crypt_protected_headers_subject defaults to "...", following the
     protected headers revised specification.
   + Date, From, To, Cc, and Reply-To headers are stored as protected headers.
   + $tunnel_is_secure, default set, assumes a connection via $tunnel is
     encrypted.  Unsetting this will cause $ssl_starttls and $ssl_force_tls
     to be respected.
   + $reply_to is consulted before $reply_self.
   + $copy_decode_weed, default unset, controls header weeding for <decode-copy>
     and <decode-save>.
   + $pipe_decode_weed, default set, enables header weeding for <pipe-message>.
   + $print_decode_weed, default set, enables header weeding for <print-message>.
   + format=flowed attachments are space-unstuffed when viewed, saved,
     piped, and printed.
   + $cursor_overlay, when set, will overlay the indicator, tree,
     sidebar_highlight, and sidebar_indicator colors onto the current line.
     "default" colors will be overridden and attributes will be merged.
   + The message-id generation algorithm uses a random number instead of
     the step counter and PID.
   + $ssl_force_tls defaults set.
   + $hostname is set *after* muttrc processing.  It can be manually set
     in the muttrc to avoid using DNS calls to obtain the FQDN.

mutt (1.14.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium
  
  /var/tmp is now used by defaults for mail drafts, rather than /tmp; this
  prevents loss of data when a laptop dies or turns itself off.

mutt (1.9.1-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  Due to the switch to upstream mutt some behaviors will have changed. This
  includes the patch implementing implicit autoview of text/html parts upon
  Return.

  The upstream behavior makes use of either 'm' to explicitly view
  parts using mailcap or setting "auto_view text/html" to enable it explicitly.

mutt (1.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting from this version, we switch mutt to the default source package
  obtained on mutt.org. Due to incompatible formatting changes the previous
  neomutt patch became bigger than the package itself and adopting it and naming
  it 'mutt' was not possible because the maintainer of Mutt objected on legal
  grounds.

  This means that, at least on this version, notmuch is not available and to
  enable the sidebar you will have to add 'set sidebar_visible' to your .muttrc
  (if you do not have it already).

mutt (1.7.0-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  As of result of the switch to gpgme in 1.7.0-2, all pgp_* commands that
  reference a pgp/gnupg command are now ignored (unless crypt_use_gpgme is
  manually set to 'no'). If you had an --encrypt-to in those commands, to
  encrypt outgoing mail to yourself, then you will have to set
  pgp_encrypt_self=yes to maintain the same behavior.

  Starting from this version of mutt, $locale is not an option anymore, you will
  have to use $attribution_locale instead, which hich controls the translation
  of the "On {date}, {user} wrote" reply string. More details
  on https://www.mail-archive.com/mutt-dev@mutt.org/msg11544.html.

  As of this version mailto_allow will also include In-Reply-To, Cc and
  References by default, to change it set mailto_allow in your ~/.muttrc.

 -- Antonio Radici <antonio@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Sep 2016 08:48:10 +0100

mutt (1.7.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting from this version, we enable 'crypt_use_gpgme=yes' by default.
  The GPGME delegates all crypto support to gnupg, which is designed to hold
  your crypto data securely.

  The drawback is that inline signatures are no longer supported in favour of
  PGP/MIME. If you need to sign your email with inline signatures please use
  'set crypt_use_gpgme=no' in your .muttrc.

  To solve #828751 we also had to add '--pinentry-mode loopback' to all commands
  in gpg.rc, that breaks compatibility with gpg v1, if you are still using gpg
  v1 please remove that option from the invocations of the command in
  /etc/Muttrc.d/gpg.rc

mutt (1.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The mutt package now incorporates the NeoMutt patchset, which includes a
  number of important security, performance and stability fixes. It also
  includes a number of UI improvements and a plethora of new features,
  including many previously shipped by Debian. Among these is the
  functionality of both the mutt-patched (sidebar, NNTP) and the mutt-kz
  (notmuch) packages, that are now both obsolete and replaced by the mutt
  package. More information about NeoMutt can be found on its website:
  http://www.neomutt.org/

  The sidebar patch has been polished up and merged upstream in what will
  eventually be Mutt 1.7.0 -- and then backported again by NeoMutt. For
  compatibility with upstream's default and since there is no mutt-patched
  package anymore, the sidebar is now off by default. Moreover, this new
  version renamed the sidebar's configuration options. To keep the old
  behavior, use this in your .muttrc:
    set mail_check_stats=yes
    set sidebar_visible=yes
    set sidebar_format="%B%*  %S%?N?(%N)?%?F?[%F]?"
    set sidebar_indent_string=" "
  and optionally:
    set sidebar_folder_indent=yes
    set sidebar_short_path=yes

  The "file_charset" option has been renamed to "attach_charset", as part of
  its inclusion upstream.

mutt (1.5.22-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The sidebar-dotted patch was replaced by the sidebar-dotpathsep patch from
  Gentoo. This new version drops the "sidebar_shortpath" option from the
  configuration. You can configure the behaviour with the
  "sidebar_delim_chars" option now.

mutt (1.5.21-2) experimental; urgency=low

  mailto-mutt has been replaced by a wrapper as per #576313, because mutt is now
  able to handle the mailto: urls; additionally it will also do some checks on
  attachments and it will allow us to be as close to upstream as possible

 -- Antonio Radici <antonio@dyne.org>  Sat, 01 Jan 2011 12:56:29 +0000

mutt (1.5.20-6) unstable; urgency=low
  The behavior of the write_bcc option has changed, now write_bcc is only
  used to decide if an Fcc message should have its Bcc header written;
  if the message is sent outside using SMTP the Bcc header will never be
  written, see the description of debian-specific/467432-write_bcc.patch
  for details

 -- Antonio Radici <antonio@dyne.org>  Tue, 19 Jan 2010 21:57:48 +0000

mutt (1.5.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As result of http://bugs.mutt.org/3097 getopt() is now used in a way that
  behaves consistently on all POSIX systems, unfortunately this has broken
  the way attachments are added from the command line.
  Now "--" is mandatory *before* any address if a file is attached from CLI,
  the mutt manpage correctly documents this behavior.

 -- Antonio Radici <antonio@dyne.org>  Sun, 14 Jun 2009 20:53:18 +0100

mutt (1.5.17-2) unstable; urgency=low

  There is now a "mutt-patched" package that will contain some more
  experimental patches. For now that is the "sidebar" patch. See
  README.Patches for details.

 -- Christoph Berg <myon@debian.org>  Tue, 01 Jan 2008 20:03:16 +0100

mutt (1.5.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  User-visible changes in this version:
  * The gpgme crypt backend is not yet stable enough, disabled again.
  * The imap_home_namespace variable was removed upstream.

 -- Christoph Berg <myon@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Jun 2007 20:58:49 +0200

mutt (1.5.14+cvs20070301-1) experimental; urgency=low

  We no longer unset write_bcc in /etc/Muttrc. If your MTA does not strip Bcc:
  headers, edit /etc/Muttrc. (exim4 and postfix strip them, exim(3) does not.)
  We also no longer unset use_from and use_domain. Mutt will use the contents
  of /etc/mailname to determine the domain part of the From: header.

  This release adds ESMTP support to mutt. To use, set smtp_url to your
  smarthost, e.g. smtps://mail.company.com/.

  The gpgme crypt backend is now enabled.

 -- Christoph Berg <myon@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Mar 2007 23:56:58 +0100

mutt (1.5.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  In this release the alternates, lists, and subscribe configuration
  variables have been turned into regular expression lists.
  Additionaly, alternates is now an option, not a  variable.
  This means that you should change:

  set alternates="foo|bar"

  into

  alternates "foo|bar"

  in your .muttrc file. See muttrc(5) for details.
